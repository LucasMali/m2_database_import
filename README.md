# m2_database_import
Magento 2 database import script for local and dev environments.

NOTE: Use this at your own discretion, this script nor I will be held responsible for murphies law.

Once cloned rename the .env.sample to .env and change the values. Once finished, you may need to run `sudo chown +x update_database.sh` before running `./update_database.sh`

There is a lot of clean up and growth this scrip can undergo. I'll be also building a python cli and gui rendition of this script.
